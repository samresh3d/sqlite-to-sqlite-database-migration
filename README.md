# SQLite to SQLite Database Migration

This repository contains a Python script that performs a data migration from a source SQLite database to a destination SQLite database. The script connects to both databases, retrieves the table information, creates tables in the destination database, and migrates the data from the source tables to the corresponding tables in the destination database.

## Prerequisites

To run the migration script, you need the following prerequisites:

- Python (version 3 or above) installed on your system.
- The `sqlite3` Python package installed. You can install it using `pip`:

#### pip install sqlite3

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract its contents.

2. Ensure that you have the source SQLite database file (`data-s.db`) and the destination SQLite database file (`data-d.db`) available in the same directory as the script.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

4. Run the migration script using the following command:

### python migration_script.py


The script will connect to the source and destination SQLite databases, retrieve the table information, create tables in the destination database if needed, and migrate the data from the source tables to the corresponding tables in the destination database.

5. Once the migration is complete, the script will close the connections and print a success message.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have the necessary privileges and access rights to both the source and destination SQLite databases.
- The script assumes that both the source and destination databases are in the same directory as the script. If they are located in different directories, update the database file paths in the script accordingly.
- Make sure to back up your databases before performing any data migration or manipulation operations.
- Verify the migrated data in the destination database to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the migration.

## Disclaimer

- This code is provided as an example and may require modifications to fit your specific use case. Use it at your own risk.
- Always backup your databases before performing any data migration or manipulation operations.
- Verify the migrated data in the destination database to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the migration.
